# Introduction to Machine Learning with Deep Learning and Computer Vision

### In this project, we’ll start by learning the basics of Python and key libraries like NumPy, pandas, and scikit-learn for data manipulation and implementing machine learning models. Next, we’ll dive into computer vision with OpenCV, exploring techniques for processing and analyzing images. As we progress, we’ll be introduced to deep learning concepts, including neural networks and frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch. In the final week, we’ll combine everything we’ve learned to build a face recognition model, using deep learning and computer vision to create a practical, real-world application.
